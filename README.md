# Fossils
Minetest mod to add bones to the game.

This Mod Includes: All bone tools, a bone block, ores underground(3)and currently unused schematics of large skeleton structures.

I'll be glad to consider any ideas or contributions!




Skeleton schematics are included for anybody's use in the project, but are not currently implemented.

Implementing this is open for contribution [issue#2-help wanted](https://github.com/TekhnaeRaav/Fossils/issues/2)

## Tool Detail

The bone tools are tough, their durability is equal to bronze tools, but they break blocks only as fast as stone tools. Bone is light which means their punch interval is very fast, and while the sword does not have more player damage than anything but wood, it has the fastest punch interval of all the tools.

## Skeletons
unused!
