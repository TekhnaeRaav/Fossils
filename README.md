# Fossils
Minetest mod to add bones to the game.

This Mod _Will_ Include: All bone tools, a bone block, ores underground(3-5 textures?)and schematics for large skeleton structures to spawn underground.

I'll be glad to consider any ideas or contributions!

## Tool Detail

The bone tools are tough, their durability is equal to bronze tools, but they break blocks only as fast as stone tools. Bone is light which means their punch interval is very fast, and while the sword does not have more player damage than anything but wood, it has the fastest punch interval of all the tools.
